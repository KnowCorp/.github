# Contributing

## Issues

Issues are very valuable to this project.

- Ideas are a valuable source of contributions others can make
- Problems show where this project is lacking
- With a question you show where contributors can improve the user
  experience

Thank you for creating them.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following
things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always
> look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me
the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

- There are no spelling mistakes
- It reads well
- For english language contributions: Has a good score on
  [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) or [Hemingway
  App](https://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

- To provide a README.md and assorted documents anyone can copy and
  paste, into their project
- The content is usable by someone who hasn't written something like
  this before
- Foster a culture of respect and gratitude in the open source
  community.

## Commits

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable tag that follows this convention:
  `<type>(<scope>): <message>`
  - `feat` for a new feature.
  - `refactor` for refactoring production code, e.g. renaming a function.
  - `docs` for changes to the documentation.
  - `fix` for a bug fix for the user.
  - `perf` for performance improvements.
  - `style` for formatting changes, missing semicolons, etc.
  - `test` for adding missing tests, refactoring tests.
  - `build` for updating build configuration, development tools or other changes irrelevant to the user.
